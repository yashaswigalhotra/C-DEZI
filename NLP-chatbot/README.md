#### A web implementation of [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) using Flask.

## Idea
In the current pandemic situation standing in the queues for registration, getting appointment and even making payment of consultation charges increases the risk of getting in contact with infection. So, we connect you directly to the hospitals and you can book appointments using our chatbot and skip the long queues and avoid the crowd at the registration counter. The consultation fees can be paid digitally using our website.

## Local Setup:
 1. Open command prompt and locate folder. run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
 2. Run *train.py*
 3. Run *run.py*
 4. Demo will be live at http://localhost:5000/
